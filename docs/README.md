# Documentation
This folder contains documentation of the code base.

TODO: 
- add `__classname__.md` for each impl in docs/impl
- add `__classname__.md` for each util in docs/util
- put hyperlinks to all impl/util in this document for clicking

## Structure
The documentation is divided into the same structure as the source code. Documentation for implementations is located in `docs/impl` and for util-classes is located in `docs/util`.
